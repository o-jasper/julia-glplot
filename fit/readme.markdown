# TODO
Get the tests working again.

# Linear fitting
Basic linear fitter. It doesn't hold a list, just a set of sums.

Also has a resistors-in-series, thing, which uses all the information
if you measure the resistance from various configurations in series.

Went a bit nuts and also wrote a pdf in `doc/`.
